# Single-Page-Portfolio
Welcome to the one page portfolio using only HTML/CSS!

At the very top, you will be greeted with the name and title of the portfolio page (presented with stylized Google fonts).

In order to navigate throughout this site, use the navigation bar located at the top of the page, beneath the title to scroll down to the section of your interest. To ensure your selecting the correct area of interest, a hover effect has been placed over each element, animating both a color change and underlining the desired link.

A hero photo was placed below the navigation bar, set with a scrolling parallax effect, to illustrate the work of the page owner.

* This page has been set for viewing via appropriate screen sizes with elements varying and changing in size. These responsive elements are placed to assist the audience viewing the page.

## About-Me
